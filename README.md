# Machine Learning Competition - CSC14005

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and documentation for the Machine Learning competition project in the **Introduction to Machine Learning (CSC14005)** course at **VNU-HCMUS**. The project involves a structured machine learning development process, including **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Model Development, and Model Evaluation**.

## Development Process
The competition follows a three-step iterative process:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Data collection** and preprocessing
- Handling **missing values, normalization, and feature engineering**
   
### 2. Model Development
- Selecting appropriate **machine learning models**
- **Training models** using different algorithms
   
### 3. Model Evaluation
- Assessing model performance with **relevant metrics**
- Analyzing **errors** and refining models

## Competition Details
- **üìå Platform:** The competition is hosted on **Kaggle**. [Competition Link](https://www.kaggle.com/t/1ad984cd42bc40b7bc76980accffef5d)
- **üìÖ Duration:** 3 weeks
- **üõ† Phases:**
  - **Phase 1:** Use **Scikit-learn** for model training and evaluation.
  - **Phase 2:** Experiment with deep learning frameworks (**PyTorch or TensorFlow**).
  - **Phase 3:** Apply boosting techniques (**XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost**).

## Submission Guidelines
### üìÇ Source Code (Jupyter Notebooks)
- Include **student/team information**.
- Provide **detailed explanations** with visuals and comments.
- Ensure the code is **formatted and re-executed** before submission.

### üìÑ Report (PDF)
- Describe each phase (**EDA, Model Development, Model Evaluation**).
- Include **observations, error analysis, and discussion** of different approaches.
- Properly format and include **references**.

### üì• Submission Format
- The final submission should be a **`.zip`** file named as follows:
  - **For individual submissions:** `StudentID.zip`
  - **For team submissions:** `StudentID1_StudentID2.zip`

## Assessment Criteria
| Phase  | Frameworks | Points |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Phase 1** | Scikit-learn | **3** |
| **Phase 2** | PyTorch or TensorFlow | **3** |
| **Phase 3** | XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost | **3** |
| **Final Report** | - | **1** |
| **Bonus (Top Rankings)** | - | **Up to 0.6** |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- Participants can **compete individually or in teams of two**.
- **Strict plagiarism policies** apply.
- **Active participation** is required with **at least one submission per week**.
