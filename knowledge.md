**What is Pearson's Correlation?**

Pearson's correlation coefficient ($r$) quantifies the **strength** and **direction** of the **linear relationship** between two continuos variables.

**Range** $-1 \leq r \leq 1$

- $r = 1 \rightarrow$ Perfect positive linear relationship
- $r = -1 \rightarrow$ Perfect negative linear relationship
- $r = 0 \rightarrow$ No linear relationship
